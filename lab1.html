          Hi, My name is Jieru(Kathy)! I’m currently pursuing my Master in
          Human-Computer Interaction at UC Berkeley, and my focus has been on
          building digital products that enhance user experience at scale. For
          example, at Pfizer, I launched an AI-powered outreach platform that
          enabled sales teams to reach over 700 previously disengaged doctors by
          delivering highly personalized, compliant content. And at Cancer
          Patient Lab, I led the end-to-end development of a healthcare chatbot
          that supports over 400 daily active users, giving patients more timely
          and trustworthy answers. Across these projects, what’s been consistent
          is my ability to understand complex user pain points, translate them
          into strategic product solutions, and drive measurable impact at
          scale.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1: AI-powered sales outreach platform at Pfizer</h3>
        <p>
          When I joined Pfizer, we were preparing for the ASCO annual meeting,
          but I noticed a major problem — 75% of doctors were disengaged, and
          reps could only reach about 80 doctors in five days by sending content
          manually. To fix this, I launched an AI-powered outreach platform with
          two key features: automation to let reps scale campaigns, and a
          matching algorithm to make sure each doctor received content aligned
          to their research. In our MVP tests, coverage expanded dramatically
          and click-through rates improved by 15%, while reps rated usability 89
          out of 100. After we scaled, over 300 reps adopted the tool, reaching
          essentially all their assigned doctors and signing up more than 700
          new ones, which boosted pre-funnel conversions by 12%. The big
          takeaway for me was learning how to go from problem discovery to full
          launch, balancing automation with personalization and driving adoption
          through training and feedback loops.
        </p>
        <h3>Project 2: Healthcare Chatbot at Start-up</h3>
        <p>
          When I was a technical product manager at Cancer Patient Lab, I led
          the end-to-end development of an LLM + RAG based healthcare chatbot.
          Our goal was to give patients immediate, trustworthy answers to
          questions about their diagnosis, treatment options, and coping
          strategies. Within 2 months, we scaled to over 400 daily active users,
          supporting 10,000 conversations where patients found crucial answers.
